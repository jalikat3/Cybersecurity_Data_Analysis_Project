# Cybersecurity_Data_Analysis_Project

This is a project I created for Fuse 201: Introduction to Intercultural Communication. I combined my interests of data analysis and cybersecurity, along with information about how cultures differ to create this essay. A final project is a map that displays information and rankings for the countires analyzed by Comparitech. A published result of this can be found at https://rpubs.com/jpurcell/984565 .
